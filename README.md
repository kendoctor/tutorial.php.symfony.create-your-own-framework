#Create your own framework with Symfony Components

This tutorial is a series of steps that explains how to create a framework with the Symfony2 Components.

Each step follows the corresponding article of [series](https://github.com/fabpot/Create-Your-Framework/tree/master/book) authored by Fabien Potencier.

Each step has a corresponding git branch, you can check it out for your study.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/kendoctor/tutorial.php.symfony.create-your-own-framework.git
```

If you want to checkout one of branches, list them first
```
$ git branch -a
* master
  remotes/origin/HEAD -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/master
  remotes/origin/part-01-class-loader
  remotes/origin/part-02-http-foundation
  remotes/origin/part-03-multiple-pages
  remotes/origin/part-04-routing
  remotes/origin/part-05-function-controller
  remotes/origin/part-06-http-kernel
  remotes/origin/part-07-simplex-framework
  remotes/origin/part-08-phpunit-test
  remotes/origin/part-09-event-dispatcher
  remotes/origin/part-10-http-cache
  remotes/origin/part-11-listener-hooks
  remotes/origin/part-12-dependency-injection
```

Checkout one branch for working copy
```
$ git checkout -b part-01 origin/part-01-class-loader
$ git branch
```
You will see you have two local branches now.
